# Introduction

The approximate number system (ANS) is a cognitive system that non-verbally estimates the numerousness, which gives individuals an immediate and intuitive sense for numbers and their association. It is generated by intraparietal sulcus neurons and area lateral intraparietal cortex neurons, and is a system ancient in evolutionary terms for numerical thought.

# Function of test

This test measures the approximate number sense of the test taker and uploads the data for analysis under consent.

# Test design

64 images with dot ratios 4:3, 7:6, 9:8, 10:9 on 2 sides of the image are created. Dots are all the same size and do not overlap. Images are shown to the test taker in a random order, each only displayed for 0.73 second, and user will choose which side contains more dots as fast as they can (within 3 seconds) and click a corresponding button. The approximate number sense is judged by the accuracy of the user's answers. Trials which user doesn't respond within 3s are considered invalid and not recorded for results.
